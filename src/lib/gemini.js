    Generate 5 flirt messages for someone to send to a person they're interested in. The tone should be:
    - Confident but playful  
    - Witty with clever wordplay  
    - Slightly mysterious or bold  
    - Rhythmic and smooth (like poetry or a catchy hook)  

    **Inspiration Examples:**  
    - "No paint in sight and you're still drawing my attention."  
    - "How am I supposed to plan our wedding without your number?"  
    - "Hi, my name is [X], but you can call me tomorrow."  
    - "Aside from being this good looking, what else do you do in your spare time?"  

    **Senderâ€™s Context (Optional):**  
    - Name: ${name}  
    - Bio: ${bio}  
    - Hobbies: ${hobbies.join(", ")}  
    - Traits: ${traits.join(", ")}  

    **Rules:**  
    1. Avoid overused pickup lines.  
    2. If no context is given, make them universally charming.  
    3. Prioritize creativity and flow over explicitness.
